 Mini Storefront

Hi, I made this project for the internship coding test.
It's a basic shopping website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with products and cart functionality. Product data is shown with different sizes and prices.

- Product listing with images, category, and variety options
- Add to cart with selected size
- Total price updates as items are added
- Search and sorting functionality
- Cart saved using localStorage (optional feature added)

The API is made using plain PHP and returns hardcoded product data in JSON format.
